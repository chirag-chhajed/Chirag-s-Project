      <h1>About us</h1>
      <article>
        At Crework, we believe that everyone deserves better. Started as a
        WhatsApp group, today we are known as a place to meet, learn and build
        with some of the smartest people in tech.

      <h3>How it started?</h3>
      <article>
        The idea of Crework was pretty simple. Students want to build projects,
        but building a project alone has its own limitation. You need people to
        work with. You need better people, people you can learn with and people
        who want you to succeed. But, finding a peer group like this is hard.

      <article>
        So, we decided to make it easy. That&prime;s how Crework batches were
        born. The first batch was just a few mentors helping 8 students trying
        to build Machine Learning projects. We tried it for the first time in
        2021 and it worked. It worked, and we knew we have to keep doing this.

      <h3>What happens in Crework?</h3>
      <article>
        In Crework, you learn to build products. We have been building an
        ecosystem where it is easier to ask questions, get personalised guidance
        from industry mentors and build projects with other people in the
        community over a fixed period of time.
      </article>
      <article>
        After successful BWU batches, we intend to leverage the community and
        this ecosystem to replicate the process of learning by building projects
        in the beginner cohorts too.
